Open Source Top-level domain name registry service

## Overview

Nomulus is an open source, scalable, cloud-based service for operating
[top-level domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain) (TLDs). It
is the authoritative source for the TLDs that it runs, meaning that it is
responsible for tracking domain name ownership and handling registrations,
renewals, availability checks, and WHOIS requests. End-user registrants (i.e.
people or companies that want to register a domain name) use an intermediate
domain name registrar acting on their behalf to interact with the registry.

Momentum is written primarily in Java. It can run any
number of TLDs in a single shared registry system using horizontal scaling. Its
source code is publicly available in this repository under the [Apache 2.0 free
and open source license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

## Getting started

The following resources provide information on getting the code and setting up a
running system:

*   [Install
    guide]()
*   [Other docs]()

If you are thinking about running a production registry service using our
platform, please drop by the user group and introduce yourself and your use
case. To report issues or make contributions, use GitHub issues and pull
requests.

## Capabilities

Momentum has the following capabilities:

*   **[Extensible Provisioning Protocol
    (EPP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Provisioning_Protocol)**: An
    XML protocol that is the standard format for communication between
    registrars and registries. It includes operations for registering, renewing,
    checking, updating, and transferring domain names.
*   **[DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) interface**: The
    registry provides a pluggable interface that can be implemented to handle
    different DNS providers. It includes a sample implementation using Google
    Cloud DNS as well as an RFC 2136 compliant implementation that works with
    BIND.
*   **[WHOIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS)**: A text-based protocol that
    returns ownership and contact information on registered domain names.
*   **[Registration Data Access Protocol
    (RDAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registration_Data_Access_Protocol)**:
    A JSON API that returns structured, machine-readable information about
    domain name ownership. It is essentially a newer version of WHOIS.
*   **[Registry Data Escrow (RDE)](https://icannwiki.com/Data_Escrow)**: A daily
    export of all ownership information for a TLD to a third party escrow
    provider to allow take-over by another registry operator in the event of
    serious failure. This is required by ICANN for all [new
    gTLDs](https://newgtlds.icann.org/).
*   **Premium pricing**: Communicates prices for premium domain names (i.e.
    those that are highly desirable) and supports configurable premium
    registration and renewal prices. An extensible interface allows fully
    programmatic pricing.
*   **Billing history**: A full history of all billable events is recorded,
    suitable for ingestion into an invoicing system.
*   **Registration periods**: Qualified Launch Partner, Sunrise, Landrush,
    Claims, and General Availability periods of the standard gTLD lifecycle are
    all supported.
*   **Brand protection for trademark holders (via
    [TMCH](https://newgtlds.icann.org/en/about/trademark-clearinghouse/faqs))**:
    Allows rights-holders to protect their brands by blocking registration of
    domains using their trademark. This is required by ICANN for all new gTLDs.
*   **Registrar support console**: A self-service web console that registrars
    can use to manage their accounts in the registry system.
*   **Reporting**: Support for required external reporting (such as [ICANN
    monthly registry
    reports](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/registry-reports),
    [CZDS](https://czds.icann.org/), Billing and Registration Activity) as well
    as internal reporting using [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/).
*   **Administrative tool**: Performs the full range of administrative tasks
    needed to manage a running registry system, including creating and
    configuring new TLDs.
*   **DNS interface**: An interface for DNS operations is provided so you can
    write an implementation for your chosen provider, along with a sample
    implementation that uses [Google Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns/).
    If you are using Google Cloud DNS you may need to understand its
    capabilities and provide your own
    multi-[AS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_\(Internet\))
    solution.
*   **GAE Proxy**: App Engine Standard only serves HTTP/S traffic. A proxy to
    forward traffic on EPP and WHOIS ports to App Engine via HTTPS is provided.
    Instructions on setting up the proxy on
    [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/)
    is [available](https://github.com/google/nomulus/blob/master/docs/proxy-setup.md).
    Running the proxy on GKE supports IPv4 and IPv6 access, per ICANN's
    requirements for gTLDs. The proxy can also run as a single jar file, or on
    other Kubernetes providers, with modifications.

## Additional components

Registry operators interested in deploying Nomulus will likely require some
additional components that are need to be configured separately.

*   A way to invoice registrars for domain name registrations and accept
    payments. Nomulus records the information required to generate invoices in
    [billing
    events](https://github.com/google/nomulus/blob/master/docs/code-structure.md#billing-events).
*   Fully automated reporting to meet ICANN's requirements for gTLDs. Nomulus
    includes substantial reporting functionality but some additional work will
    be required by the operator in this area.
*   A secure method for storing cryptographic keys. A keyring interface is
    provided for plugging in your own implementation (see [configuration
    doc](https://github.com/google/nomulus/blob/master/docs/configuration.md)
    for details).
*   System status and uptime monitoring.

## Outside references

*   [CoCCa](http://cocca.org.nz) and [FRED](https://fred.nic.cz) are other
    open-source registry platforms in use by many TLDs
*   We are not aware of any fully open source domain registrar projects, but
    open source EPP Toolkits (not yet tested with Momentum; may require
    integration work) include:
    *   [EPP RTK Project](http://epp-rtk.sourceforge.net/)
    *   [CentralNic](https://www.centralnic.com/registry/labs)

    tested:
